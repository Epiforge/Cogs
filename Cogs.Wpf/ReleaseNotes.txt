We removed a generic argument constraint in the implementation of the ComboBoxDataVirtualization and ListBoxDataVirtualization behaviors. The behaviors now tolerate sources with generic type arguments that that do not implement IDataVirtualizationItem, averting an unhandled exception during XAML markup parsing. Even in this case, items in the source may still be virtualized due to contravariance (the list's generic argument is less derived than the actual type of its items, which does implement IDataVirtualizationItem).
