We made the generic type parameter of IObservableActiveExpression covariant and the generic type parameter of IObserveActiveExpressions contravariant, which means the observer can be using a less derived value type than the observed active expression. We corrected a possible null reference exception in testing the equality of MemberInitExpressions. We corrected a possible deadlock in the observer pattern implemented in this minor version.
