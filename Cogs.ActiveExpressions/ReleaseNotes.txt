We added IObservableActiveExpression and IObserveActiveExpressions to implement an observer pattern to internally replace the property change pattern from the BCL's component model. This eliminates the need to allocate property change handler delegates on the heap and can have a dramatic impact on performance and memory usage. Also, the public ActiveExpression classes are now sealed (breaking if you derived from them).
