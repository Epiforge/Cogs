This library provides a number of utilities surrounding collections:

* `EquatableList<T>` is an immutable list of items which may be compared with other instances of the same type and produces a hash code based on the permutation of its contents.
* `INotifyGenericCollectionChanged<T>` is similar to the BCL's `INotifyCollectionChanged` except that it is a generic and therefore provides event arguments aware of the type of the collection.
* `NullableKeyDictionary<TKey, TValue>` and `NullableKeySortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>` are very slim implementations of `IDictionary<TKey, TValue>` that allow a single null key (useful for some edge cases in which a null key is simply going to happen and you need to be able to deal with it; otherwise, use other dictionary classes)
* `ObservableDictionary<TKey, TValue>` and `ObservableSortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>` are counterparts to the BCL's `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` and `SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`, respectively, that implement the also included `IRangeDictionary<TKey, TValue>` and `INotifyDictionaryChanged<TKey, TValue>`. Ever want to add multiple items to a dictionary at once... or keep an eye on what's being done to it? Now you can.
* `OrderedHashSet<T>` is a counterpart to the BCL's `HashSet<T>` that maintains the order of the elements in the set. All operations are still *O(1)*, just like the original, but if you enumerate over it you will get elements in the exact order they were added. There are also methods for manipulating the order.
