This library offers the `PropertyChangeNotifier` class, which you may inherit from to quickly get all the property utilities we're all tired of copying and pasting everywhere.
Just call the protected `OnPropertyChanged` and `OnPropertyChanging` methods at the appropriate times from setters and compiler services will figure out what property you're in.
Or, if all you need to do is set the value of a field, `SetBackedProperty` couldn't make it any easier or convenient to handle that as efficiently as possible.
`DynamicPropertyChangeNotifier` is also available if your class needs to be dynamic.
